    "## Problem 2: Calculating NDVI (12 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will work with the same satellite imagery data as we used during the lesson. Specifically, we will explore the Sentinel-2 satellite image from Nuuksio National Park in Finland. The data is obtained from the [Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu). Our objective is to explore, process the data, and ultimately calculate the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is NDVI?\n",
    "\n",
    "NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is a simple, widely used index for assessing vegetation health and coverage based on satellite imagery. NDVI is calculated by comparing the Near Infrared (NIR) and Red bands of satellite data. Vegetation reflects more NIR light and absorbs more visible red light, so the NDVI value provides insight into the density and health of vegetation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula to calculate NDVI is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "NDVI = \\frac{(NIR - Red)}{(NIR + Red)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NIR (Near Infrared)** corresponds to Band 8 for Sentinel-2 imagery.\n",
    "- **Red** corresponds to Band 4 for Sentinel-2 imagery.\n",
    "\n",
    "NDVI values range from -1 to +1, where higher values indicate healthier and denser vegetation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentinel-2 Band Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "For Sentinel-2 imagery, the bands are predefined and consistent across products. Here is a quick reference for the Sentinel-2 bands:\n",
